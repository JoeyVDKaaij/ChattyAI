# ChattyAI
An AI you can talk to. Made in Python version 3+.

<h3>How to set it up:</h3>
The program uses keys and regions from OpenAI and Azure. Set up your credit card and subscriptions on those services before using this program. 

1) Download Python version 3+.
2) Download the python source code.
3) Go to windows settings.
4) Go to the about section.
5) Go to Advance Settings.
6) Go to Environment Variables.
7) Make the variables Azure_Api_Key, Azure_Region and Open_API_Key and set the correct keys and region.
8) Test it out if it works.

If you are using a mac or other non-windows devices. Look into how you can set environment variables for those devices. You can also hardcode the keys and regions by replacing functions like os.getenv('Azure_Api_Key') with your keys and regions and that should also work.
